PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Hi, there. I’m Commissioner Gordon. First of all, thank you all for helping me to collect the Bat-Signal. But I have bad news. Just when we were assembling the last part of Bat-Signal, a piece of card is dropped from the machine. On the back of the card, the note above was written. When we tried to run Bat-Signal later, we understood what the note meant. Joker had sabotaged all cables of Bat-Signal and set up a setting. Now, we are in this situation: we have lots of cables, and ports just as much as the cables. Each cable produces a diﬀerent voltage when connected to a diﬀerent port. To run Bat-Signal we need the maximum voltage and each cable must be connected to one port. Finally, we have only one chance of trying...
So, we are looking for fast programmers who can calculate the maximum voltage in this setting, therefore we prepared some test cases.
I believe that this will be the last game of Joker. Let’s light up the sky!

Let us share what we ﬁgured out until now in order to ﬁnd a fast solution.

•	This problem is solvable with a minimum-cost maximum-ﬂow (MCMF) modeling ap-proach and we expect you to model the test cases accordingly. We are aware that MCMF might be unfamiliar to you, but an excellent programmer is the one who ﬁnds a way through in the darkness!

•	For MCMF modeling, you will need cost and capacities on each edge. Determine them wisely to ﬁnd the maximum voltage.

•	When the modeling is complete, you will ﬁnd the algorithm for MCMF problems. The algorithm needs to ﬁnd negative cycles.
